      <p><b>Hundreds of thousands of people are without power as Hurricane Fiona<br/>began to batter Canada's Atlantic Coast.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Parts of Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick are<br/>experiencing torrential rain and winds of up to 148 km/h (92 mph).
      </p>
      <p>The Canadian Hurricane Centre warned ahead of its arrival that Fiona could be<br/> "a historic, extreme event", with expected power cuts and flooding.
      </p>
      <p>At least eight people died when Fiona cut through the Caribbean.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be a bad one," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday. "We<br/> encourage everyone to stay safe and to listen to the instructions of local<br/>authorities and hang in there for the next 24 hours."
      </p>
      <p>Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Atlantic provinces of Nova Scotia,<br/> Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, as well as in parts of<br/> Quebec.
      </p>
      <p>The country's eastern region could receive up to 10in (25cm) of rain, increasing<br/> the risk of flash flooding.
      </p>

    <div class="Three">
      <p>In Nova Scotia, shelters were prepared in Halifax and Cape Breton for people<br/> to take cover ahead of the storm.
      </p>
      <p>"We have been through these types of events before, but my fear is, not to this<br/> extent," said Amanda McDougall, mayor of Cape Breton Regional Municipality.
      </p>
      <p>"The impacts are going to be large, real and immediate."</p>
      <p>Severe hurricanes in Canada are rare, as storms lose their energy once they hit<br/> colder waters in the north and become post-tropical instead. But pressure in<br/> the region is predicted to be historically low as Hurricane Fiona hits, making<br/> way for a heavier storm.
      </p>
      <p>Nova Scotia was last battered by a tropical cyclone in 2003 with Hurricane<br/> Juan, a category two storm that killed two people and heavily damaged<br/> structures and vegetation.
      </p>
      <p>Meteorologist Bob Robichaud warned on Friday afternoon that Fiona will be<br /> bigger than Juan, and stronger than 2019's Hurricane Dorian, which also<br /> reached the shores of Nova Scotia.
      </p>

    <div class="Four">
      <p>"It is certainly going to be a historic, extreme event for Atlantic Canada."</p>
      <p>Fiona had already wreaked havoc on Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic<br/> earlier this week, with many still left without power or running water.
      </p>
      <p>Florida also faces a hurricane threat as tropical storm Ian strengthened as it<br />moved over the Caribbean on Saturday. It could approach Florida early next<br /> week as a major hurricane.
      </p>
      <p>Ian's projected path takes it just south of Jamaica, over western Cuba and into<br />Florida, the hurricane centre said.
      </p>
      <p>Florida Keys and South Florida could be hit by heavy rains on Monday,<br /> according to
        <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/241147.shtml" target="_blank">forecasters.</a>
      </p>
      <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Friday,<br /> freeing up funding and emergency services in advance of the storm.
